# HistoryBlog
Any tips on how to improve this would be awesome, even if it involves me learning a little JavaScript so I can make it more of a dynamic webpage.

Couple things on my mind?
How can I make the website live?
How can I make my website more popular on google and attract clicks more often. Per say when someone types "U.S. History Blog" or something along those lines.
How do I code the fact of the day without having to change my code every day?
What else should I add?
  
    Side note: I need to add a linkedIn button to my blog and my outlook email signature. CREATE ONE FIRST!
