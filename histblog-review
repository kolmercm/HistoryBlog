HistoryBlog Review:

Suggestions:
- could caption your photos
  ex:  <figure>
          <img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
          <figcaption>Fig.1 - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
        </figure>

- try to break up some of the longer paragraphs into smaller paragraphs, if possible

- let me know if you have any questions about javascript

- (optional) you could center your photos, but I think they look fine as they are as well.

- use an icon for your "follow me on twitter" section
  - move the "follow me on twitter" section somewhere more visible


What I did:
- closed <head> tag before starting the <body> tag.
- added a couple <meta> tags for accessibilty
- moved the twitter <script> into the <head> tag so its loaded with page
- changed padding of card from 20px to 3%
- added media query to adjust the width of the cards on larger screens
- changed font-family of paragraph text to 'Helvetica', sans-serif,
  - added 'paragraph' class to paragraph text. see stylesheet for details
- changed * { box-sizing: border-box } to "inherit", and set: html { box-sizing: border-box } instead.
- commented out the broken twitter <script> (and left url to documentation)

javascript:
- added 'example.js' to show a few examples
- used Fetch to implement an example random facts request, and update the page
  - with a button to get another fact
- implemented an example click event listener
